    <!-- The home.css file is not directly accessible by default. 
    To make it accessible, we need to serve the static files using Express:
    app.use(express.static('public')); 
    or 
    app.use(express.static('public/css')); // This is more secure.
    
    In the href attribute, we didn't provide the full path, but it's still accessible because
    app.use() handles the location, so only the filename is needed here. -->
